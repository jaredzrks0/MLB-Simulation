        Rolls neutralized batting and pitching statistics across the tracked play types, aggregating the stats 
        on both a season and monthly basis, and ensures that the stats sum to 1 for each play type. 

        This function takes the output of `neutralize_stats`, which contains adjusted batting and pitching 
        stats with weather and park factors, and rolls the stats using a window-based calculation for both 
        batting and pitching. It calculates aggregated statistics for each player and then normalizes them 
        to ensure the percentages sum to 1.

        - Batting statistics with league averages for each play type for the last season and month.

        The function performs the following steps:
        1. Adds pitching statistics to the batting dataset based on the pitbat combo (combination of batter/pitcher handedness).
        2. Merges weather data into the batting dataset, ensuring that weather information is associated with the correct game date.
        3. Calculates league averages for each play type in the past season and month based on the game date.
        4. Cleans up unnecessary columns and adds a binary `is_on_base` column to identify if the batter is on base.

        Notes:
        ------
        - The weather data is merged based on the `game_pk` (game identifier).
        - League averages are calculated using rolling windows for the past 365 days (season) and the past 30 days (month).
        - Missing weather data will be filled with NaN values.
        - The `is_on_base` column is binary: 1 if the player is on base (e.g., single, double, triple, home run, walk), otherwise 0.
