    "### - Add in num batters faced for pitcher in game or inning (also maybe a rest metric like days since last pitched if its easy)\n",
    "### Figure out why unnamed cols get added every pull and push from google cloud and stop that from happening (takes up data space)\n",
    "### I wonder if we might undercount runs due to not all errors being counted as such. We could calculate the odds of runners advancing on things like out and fly out (non3b) to stop this.\n",
    "### I wonder if we're potentially overcounting whatever the most recent play(s) for individual players are, as we roll by at bats rather than rolling at bats every game or even week. For example, if you do play x, particularly in a smaller sample, the percentage immedietly jumps and slowly lowers until it happens again. Additionally, when simulating we (should) update percentages with each at bat in game if we do this in training...\n",
