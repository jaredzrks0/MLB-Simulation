        Combines batting and pitching statistics for each batter-pitcher handedness combination (pitbat combo)

        DataFrame for each category.

        Parameters:
        --------------
        rolling_factored_stats (dict): 
            A dictionary containing the rolled and neutralized batting and pitching stats, with keys "batting_stats"

            the individual player's play data and their rolled statistics.

        -----------------
        Returns:
        --------------
        dict: A dictionary containing two DataFrames:
            - "batting_stats": A DataFrame with concatenated batting stats for all `pitbat_combo` combinations.
            - "pitching_stats": A DataFrame with concatenated pitching stats for all `pitbat_combo` combinations.

        The returned dictionary structure is as follows:
        {
            "batting_stats": DataFrame with concatenated batting stats,
            "pitching_stats": DataFrame with concatenated pitching stats

        Example:
        - If the input `rolling_factored_stats` contains multiple DataFrames for different handedness combinations, 
        this function will combine them into a single DataFrame for batting and pitching stats.

        Merges batting, pitching, league averages, and weather data into a final dataset for analysis.

        This function performs several merges to combine:
        - Batting statistics with pitching statistics.
        - Batting statistics with weather data based on the game date.
        - Batting statistics with league averages for each play type for the last season and month.

        The function performs the following steps:
        1. Adds pitching statistics to the batting dataset based on the pitbat combo (combination of batter/pitcher handedness).
        2. Merges weather data into the batting dataset, ensuring that weather information is associated with the correct game date.
        3. Calculates league averages for each play type in the past season and month based on the game date.
        4. Cleans up unnecessary columns and adds a binary `is_on_base` column to identify if the batter is on base.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        stitched_dataset : dict
            A dictionary containing the following DataFrames:
            - "batting_stats" (DataFrame): Contains the batting statistics for each game.
            - "pitching_stats" (DataFrame): Contains the pitching statistics for each game.

        cleaned_raw_pitches : dict
            A dictionary where keys are `pitbat` combinations (e.g., 'R/L', 'L/R') and values are DataFrames containing weather data for each game.

        Returns:
        --------
        DataFrame
            The updated "batting_stats" DataFrame with merged pitching statistics, weather data, league averages, and the new `is_on_base` column.

        Notes:
        ------
        - The weather data is merged based on the `game_pk` (game identifier).
        - League averages are calculated using rolling windows for the past 365 days (season) and the past 30 days (month).
        - Missing weather data will be filled with NaN values.
        - The `is_on_base` column is binary: 1 if the player is on base (e.g., single, double, triple, home run, walk), otherwise 0.
